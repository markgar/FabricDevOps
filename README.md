# Fabric DevOps Workshop

A hands-on workshop for learning source control and DevOps practices with Microsoft Fabric.

> 💡 **GitHub or Azure DevOps?** This workshop uses GitHub for examples, but the process works almost exactly the same with Azure DevOps. Both platforms use Git, so the core concepts—commits, branches, pull requests—are identical.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Fabric capacity (trial or paid)
- A GitHub account OR an Azure DevOps organization
- For GitHub: A [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with **repo** scope (classic) or **Contents** read/write permission (fine-grained)

> ⚠️ **Admin Note:** Your Fabric tenant admin must enable "Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories" in the admin portal. If you can't see the Git integration option, contact your admin.
